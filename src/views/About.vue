        A little bit about
        <span>Meteor :</span>
      </h2>
      <p>Meteor gives you the confidence that everything’s organized and accounted for, so you can make progress on the things that are important to you.</p>
      <h4>What features does the app offer?</h4>
      <p>🥽 Get a clear overview of everything on your plate and never lose track of an important task.</p>
      <p>🎉 As you complete tasks, the progress meter fills giving you a sense of achievement</p>
      <p>🎪 Paused items: feel free to put off things and do them later when you like.</p>
      <p>🎁 Don't need to login anywhere, the app uses your browser's localStorage to store your todos</p>
      <h4>A bit of a warning ( nothing serious though )</h4>
      <p>
        🚩 App uses localStorage to store your todos, which means your todos will be deleted when
        (a) you clear browsing data,
        (b) cookies are selected to be cleared
        (this can be different for different browsers)
      </p>
      <p>🚩 This is a TODO app, so don't be stupid and store your passwords, credit card PINs or your address. Infact don't store any of this anywhere, keep it to yourself.</p>
      <h4>Made using:</h4>
